# World-Bank

This app will make banking easier, faster, and manageable. This app/website will also give you also of budgeting tool, and two account, which is a checking account and a savings account (There might be a third account for investment to "free game" for you but it's up in the air). There are different budgeting tools. For example, you have that 70/30 budget plan where for every deposit that goes into your account, it can take 70% of that and put it into your checking account and then put the 30% into your savings account. It can give you statistical data and graphs about how much you spend or deposit your money (Maybe a Summary) for each month. (Maybe compare each year up to 3 to 4 years MAYBE) Also, it has to be fast with big data sets, and this can only be solved by testing.

There should be basically two types of users as of right now, which are the normal user and the admin.

# Philosophy
I'm just tired of banks, that don't give you a lot of information on your banking, or very little, and also you have to pay or go to a third-party service to get some financial help (even if they do they don't tell you) or manually do it yourself. As a beginner or someone that don't want to worry about it, I have to manually do this, how about just doing it for me with ease and just watch it? Also, why has banking been slow for some time? I mean it might not be bad but it can be better. I'm investing my money in all, and I should have some type of financial or statical data and budgeting tools that are free and easy to use

# Tech stack
This app/website will be using react-native so that any smartphone can use it. Also using different react-native libraries.
The database -In progress-. There should be notifications based on different statistical data.
